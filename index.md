# What Are We Exploring?

![vote](vote.jpg)

This project examines claims made by presidential candidates about factors that impact Americans' daily lives. The goal of this project is to provide voters with a clear, data-driven understanding of key political issues: student loan debt, economic health, immigration, and crime. Through narrative visualizations, we aim to help voters make informed decisions based on facts and trends, rather than rhetoric alone.

## What Are Student Loans?

Student loans are financial tools that help individuals cover the cost of higher education, including tuition, housing, and other expenses. Federal loans, provided by the government, are among the most common, with varying types for undergraduate and graduate students.

## Why Are Student Loans Important?

In the United States, student loan debt exceeds $1.7 trillion, affecting nearly 45 million Americans. Student debt can impact quality of life, delay home ownership, and even affect career choices. This issue has been central to recent presidential debates, with candidates proposing different solutions, including loan forgiveness and income-driven repayment plans. Understanding the nuances of student loans—who carries this debt, how it’s distributed across demographics, and how it impacts economic choices—is essential to informed voting on related policy proposals.

## How Do Student Loans Affect Americans?

This section will visualize data on student loans by age, education level, institution type, and major. We’ll look at:

- **Loan Type**: Federal undergraduate vs. graduate loans.
- **Age & Marital Status**: How debt varies by age and marital status.
- **Institution Type**: Comparing debt across public, private nonprofit, and for-profit institutions.
- **Major**: Which fields of study correlate with higher debt levels, reflecting varying educational costs and potential income after graduation.

## Terminology to Know

- **Federal Undergraduate Loans**: Loans issued by the federal government for undergraduate students, often with lower interest rates and varying repayment options.
- **Federal Graduate Loans**: Loans available for graduate students, often at higher interest rates.
- **Loan Forgiveness**: Programs or policies that relieve borrowers from repaying part or all of their federal loans.
- **Income-Driven Repayment (IDR)**: A repayment plan that bases monthly payments on the borrower’s income and family size, intended to make repayment more manageable for low-income earners.

## The National Average Student Loan Debt Amount Is **$46,697**.

The bar graph below unpacks the complexities of student loan debt through three major lenses: Institution **Type and Major**, **Racial and Gender Disparities**, and **Personal Circumstances**, offering crucial insights that can shape your understanding of education policy debates.

- **Institution Type and Major**: The type of college and choice of major heavily influence borrowing outcomes. Students at for-profit institutions have the highest average debt of $54,900, compared to $41,200 at public colleges. Additionally, fields of study like biological and physical sciences lead to the highest debt at $71,300, whereas business and education majors have some of the lowest debt levels, around $37,000 to $38,000. Voters may weigh these differences when evaluating candidates’ proposals for regulating higher education costs or expanding access to public institutions.

- **Racial and Gender Disparities**: The data highlights significant inequities, with Black students carrying the highest average debt ($57,700) and women borrowing more than men ($46,900 versus $44,200). These disparities underline systemic challenges that some candidates aim to address through loan forgiveness or targeted financial support for underserved communities. Voters who are impacted by or care about these inequities might consider how each candidate’s policies could help bridge these financial gaps.

- **Personal Circumstances**: Age and marital status further impact borrowing, as older students (30 or older) borrow more on average ($45,600) and unmarried individuals with dependents have the highest debt burden at $49,100. In contrast, married individuals with dependent children tend to have lower debt at $39,200. Candidates who propose relief for older borrowers or support systems for single parents might influence voters facing these challenges.

## What is the Federal Student Loan Distribution among US College Students?

The chart below provides a breakdown of federal student loan distribution among U.S. college students based on various demographic factors, including age, institution type, major, and marital status. It distinguishes between federal undergraduate loans (in orange) and federal graduate loans (in blue) to highlight how loan reliance varies across different student profiles.

Key takeaways:

- Younger students (23 or younger) primarily rely on federal undergraduate loans, while those aged 30 or older have a relatively high dependency on federal graduate loans, reflecting older students' greater participation in graduate programs.
- Students at for-profit institutions tend to rely more on federal undergraduate loans compared to those at public or private nonprofit institutions, which may indicate higher tuition costs at for-profits.
- Across majors, those studying healthcare and business have notable amounts of both undergraduate and graduate loans, whereas majors like humanities and social sciences show less reliance on federal graduate loans.

## How would student loan forgiveness impact the average borrower?

![borrower data](Average_amount_per_borrower.png)

Let us start by examining the average amount owed per borrower. This value was calculated by dividing the total amount of federal
student loans divided by the number of unique borrowers. This value has steadily grown every year at roughly the same amount. Only
recently, under the Biden administration have we seen dips in the amount owed. 

We read through both campaign websites to get a better understanding of the exact claims made by candidates regarding student loan forgiveness.
The Harris/Walz campaign is for student loan forgiveness, but the Trump/Vance ticket does not make specific claims either for or against.
However on the campaign trail, former president Trump has argued against student loan forgiveness. 

In this hypothetical example, we consider what would happen if student loan forgiveness became policy. 
The average monthly payment for a federal student loan with a 10-year term at a 6.8% apr of 38000 is 430$. Again, this 38000$
figure comes from dividing the total outstanding amount by the number of unqiue borrowers. 
If the debt was cancelled and the borrower put this into a stock market index fund tracking the popular S&P500 ETF 
(like SPY), they would end up with 75,000$

Considering the average home price is 400,000$, with a little more saving, that could be a downpayment on a house!

# Economy

Despite being the world's richest country (as measured by GDP), the US economy grapples with extreme inequality. 
Both parties claim to better represent the needs of the working class and to be better for the economy.
While the president does not have any magic levers on their desk to improve or crash the economy, they set the tone for the country
and help direct the nation's economic journey. 

Let us examine how the Biden/Harris (now Harris/Walz) ticket would do as compared to the Trump/Pence (now Trump/Vance) ticket.

## What is the economy?

Before we can get started with analyzing the claims, how should we define the economy? Various measures exist to capture 
the state of the economy. Median wages, GDP, GDP growth, inflation, unemployment, job creation, S&P500, are all reasonable
stand-ins to measure the average family's annual income. Of course, each metric has its own pros and cons.

Let us start with a famous question asked by then presidential candidate Reagan in his debate with Carter. 

*"Are you better off today than you were four years ago?"*

We chose to analyse the median household income and job growth as a proxy to measure the economy. We chose to not focus on
GDP, or the stock market, as those metrics can be skewed by the large population, or by the fact that only a small subset
of Americans are actually invested in the stock market.

## Median Household Income
We chose to examine this question by looking at the median household income of families in the US.

![median_wealth](Median_family_wealth.png)

Since we used data from census records and government datasets, the most recent data ends midway through the first Trump presidency.
Comparing the change in income from the beginning of the Obama/Biden administration, we observe that incomes rose roughly 24%. Similarly,
For the first two years of the Trump presidency, we observe a change of 12%. 

Of course, these numbers by themselves are not particularly helpful. It is important to remember that the economy operates in a 
continuum and that it doesn't reset at the end of each presidential term. President Obama handed off a fantastic economy to 
President elect Trump. Unemployment was at historic lows, GDP growth was good, the stock market was doing well. President Trump,
signed the 2017 tax cuts into law, further stimulating an already red hot economy. This also, undoubtedly helped bouy the 
median household income. 

## Job growth (Non-Farm)

A key concern for any president is the unemployment and jobs being created by the economy. A high unemployment can lead to
a plethora of economic ails that would derail the economy. Job growth data excludes farm jobs as they are highly seasonal and can
introduce a great deal of fluctuations.

![job growth](non_farm_jobs.png)

We managed to gather data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and mapped the job growth/losses and color coded the years 
with the color of the party that controlled the presidency. Right off the bat, an interesting trend is visible. 
Republican presidents frequently leave office with some kind of economic crisis (We are not stating that they are responsible).

From 1980 onward, job growth trends across presidential terms reveal notable differences in economic performance,
particularly under the Biden/Harris and Trump/Pence administrations. Excluding the anomalous years of 2020 and 2021 due
to the COVID-19 pandemic, Biden/Harris have overseen a robust rebound in non-farm job growth, averaging approximately 
4.5 million jobs added annually during their first two years in office. This is a stark contrast to Trump/Pence’s term,
which, pre-pandemic, averaged about 2.3 million jobs per year between 2017 and 2019. While Trump’s early years 
reflected consistent job creation, Biden’s administration stands out for its rapid recovery and significant gains 
as the economy bounced back from the pandemic-induced downturn. 

Again, it is important to remember that Trump inherited low unemployment from Obama (which does also make it harder 
to show strong job creation), but also averaged fewer jobs created than his predecessor and successor. 

# Immigration and Crime
Immigration has been a very hot topic in the most recent election, with both presidential candidates making various claims about recent immigration trends and their effect on the US. One side, Harris claimed that Biden's administration "halved the flow of immigrants" into the country. On the other, however, Trump has claimed that the day he left office experienced the "lowest illegal immigration in US history", and that the Biden administration has spent "millions" bringing in immigrants from other countries. He also claimed that immigrants "poison the blood of our society", referring to them as "animals" and "rough people". In the following we study the claims made by both candidates with the goal of verifying or disproving their various aspects.

## Estimated History of Illegal Immigration in Sanctuary and Non-Sanctuary States
The first aspect we study is the flow of undocumented immigrants into the country. More specifically, we study the flow of undocumented immigrants from all counties from 2006 to 2022 (excluding 2021). We show the history for the top 10 states in which undocmented immigrants reside, and all the numbers for all other states are lumped under "other". Note that the color of area corresponding to a certain state encodes whether it is a sanctuary state or not. A sanctuary state is one where the undocumented immigrants are protected from deportation to a certain extent. Finally, the line at the top of the plot encodes whether the president was a Democrat or a Republican at each point in time.

<iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/michael.ibrahim6432/viz/crime_immigration_viz_Stacked/Stacked?:showVizHome=no&:embed=true" width="1000" height="800"></iframe>

A key takeaway is that the graph indeed confirms Trump's claim that the lowest recorded illegal immigration rate into the US was towards the end of his presidency. However, it is important to note the context, as this is not just purely based on his policies. This was during the time Covid was at its peak, which certainly contributed to the low immigration rate. It is worth noting that through his presidency, though, illegal immigration was steadily declining, and was generally lower than any other time since 2006. It is hard to study Harris' claim that Biden's administration halved the flow of immigrants into the country, as data is not available for 2023 and 2024 yet.

## Overall Documented Immigration and Crime Trends
Next, we attempt to study the relationship, if any, between immigration rates and crime rates. We study this to address the rhetoric that immigrants are criminals, and they contribute to rising crime rates in America. We do this via a simple line graph, demonstrating the average immigrant rate across all documented immigration statuses and across all states from 2013 to 2022, and another line demonstrating the average crime rate across all crimes and all states from 2014 to 2023. Note that the immigrant rate is per 1M residents, whereas the crime rate is per 100k residents. 

<iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/michael.ibrahim6432/viz/crime_immigration_viz_Line/Line?:showVizHome=no&:embed=true" width="1000" height="800"></iframe>

While correlation does not mean causation, the graph does not even show a correlation between immigrant rate and crime rate. Indeed, crime has been steadily declining since 2014, with a slight bump in 2022 most likely due to the economic pressure induced by Covid. On the other hand, documented immigration showed an increasing trend from 2012 to 2019, with a very sharp drop in 2020 and 2021 due to Covid, and finally an increase again in 2022. This disproves claims that immigration rates have any relationship with crime. However, someone may argue that the concern arises from undocumented immigrants, not documented ones. Indeed, president elect Trump's policy is to execute a mass deportation of undocumented immigrants in an attempt to address allegedly rising crime rates. Therefore, we study the relationship between deportation policies and crime rates in the following visualization.

## Crime Rate Rankings of All States
As mentioned previously, Sanctuary states are those that provide some protection to undocumented immigrants from deportation. If president elect Trump's claims that undocumented immigrants are contributing largely to the crime rates in America, such states should rank higher than non-sanctuary states on many crimes. We study this via the following bump chart.

<iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/michael.ibrahim6432/viz/crime_immigration_viz_Bump/Bump?:showVizHome=no&:embed=true" width="1000" height="800"></iframe>

The chart provides some interaction capabilities to the user, enabling them to choose a specific type of crime or highlight a specific state to observe its history. The sanctuary states are shown in dark grey, whereas the non-sanctuary states are shown in light grey. The key takeaway from this chart is that across all crimes, the sanctuary states are dispersed across all rankings amongst the other states. This effectively disproves the claim that undocumented immigrants are the driving force for crime in America.

## Explore Crime Rate and Immigrant Rate Trends!
In our final visualization, we give the user the ability to explore trends in crime and documented immigrant rates via two choropleth maps utilizing dynamic querying. The top one displays the crime rate in the each state averaged over the selected time period. It also gives the user to filter by type of crime. The bottom one shows the immigrant rate averaged over the selected time period, and gives the user the ability to filter by immigrant status.

# Final Takeaway
While this project might be coming a little too late (since the elections already happened), we hope that it serves as inspiration for individuals to go out and do their own research before casting their votes. Voting is a very big responsibility, and therefore one should not take it lightly or base it solely on claims or anecdotal evidence provided by politicians. Instead, it should be based on sound research and the thorough examination of the facts at hand.
